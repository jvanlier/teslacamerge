teslacamerge
============
Python tool for merging TeslaCam SavedClips.

I've realised that these videos are best watched side-by-side, and usually the interesting bits are in the very last videos. This tool will, for each SavedClip, take the last 3 minutes, all 3 videos, and stitch them together. Also, videos will be 2x speed (without dropping frames or resolution; the output is 80 FPS).

## Initial rudimentary version
After a few hours of hacking, got something working. Quite slow, but functional:

```
